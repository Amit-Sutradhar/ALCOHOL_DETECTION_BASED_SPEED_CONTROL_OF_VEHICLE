#Alcohol Detection Vehicle Control System
This is a project that uses an MQ-135 sensor and a servo motor to control the speed of a vehicle based on the alcohol percentage detected from the driver's breath.

#Components
Arduino Uno
MQ-135 sensor
Servo motor
Jumper wires

#How it works
The MQ-135 sensor measures the alcohol concentration in the air exhaled by the driver, and outputs an analog value. The analog value is converted to a percentage using the map() function, and the motor speed is reduced based on the percentage.

If the alcohol percentage is between 5% and 10%, the motor speed is reduced by 60%. If the alcohol percentage is 12% or higher, the motor speed is reduced by 80%. Otherwise, the motor runs at full speed.

The motor speed is controlled by sending a PWM signal to the servo motor using the write() function. The motor speed and alcohol percentage are displayed on the serial monitor.

Getting started
To use this project, you will need an Arduino Uno, an MQ-135 sensor, a servo motor, and jumper wires. Follow these steps to get started:

Connect the MQ-135 sensor to the analog pin A0 on the Arduino Uno, and connect the servo motor to pins 9 and 10.
Upload the code to the Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.
Open the serial monitor to see the motor speed and alcohol percentage.
Future improvements
This project can be improved in several ways:

Add a buzzer or LED to alert the driver when the motor speed is reduced.
Implement a more accurate alcohol detection method, such as a breathalyzer.
Add a GPS module to track the location of the vehicle and alert the authorities if the driver is under the influence.
Implement a system to prevent the vehicle from starting if the alcohol percentage is above a certain threshold.
